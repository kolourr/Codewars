Product Array (Array Series #5)

Introduction and Warm-up (Highly recommended)
Playing With Lists/Arrays Series
Task
Given an array/list [] of integers , Construct a product array Of same size Such That prod[i] is equal to The Product of all the elements of Arr[] except Arr[i].

Notes
Array/list size is at least 2 .

Array/list's numbers Will be only Positives

Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.

Input >> Output Examples
productArray ({12,20}) ==>  return {20,12}

productArray ({1,5,2}) ==> return {10,2,5}
Explanation:
The first element 10 is the product of all array's elements except the first element 1

The second element 2 is the product of all array's elements except the second element 5

The Third element 5 is the product of all array's elements except the Third element 2.




function productArray(numbers)
{
  let multiplication = numbers.reduce((previousValue, currentValue) => previousValue * currentValue);
  return numbers.map(element => multiplication / element);
}
