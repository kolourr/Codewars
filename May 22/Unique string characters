In this Kata, you will be given two strings a and b and your task will be to return the characters that are not common in the two strings.

For example:

solve("xyab","xzca") = "ybzc" 
--The first string has 'yb' which is not in the second string. 
--The second string has 'zc' which is not in the first string. 
Notice also that you return the characters from the first string concatenated with those from the second string.


function solve(a,b){
    let arrA = a.split("")
    let arrB = b.split("")
    
     let arrC = arrA.filter((item, index, arr) => {
        if(!arrB.includes(item)){
          return item 
        }
     })
     
      let arrD = arrB.filter((item, index, arr) => {
        if(!arrA.includes(item)){
          return item 
        }
     })
     
     return arrC.concat(arrD).join("")
   };

   Better solution 

   function solve(a,b) {
    let setA = new Set(a);
    let setB = new Set(b);
    return [...(a+b)].filter(c => setA.has(c) ^ setB.has(c)).join("");
  };
