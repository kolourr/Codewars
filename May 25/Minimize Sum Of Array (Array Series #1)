Introduction and Warm-up (Highly recommended)
Playing With Lists/Arrays Series

Task
Given an array of integers , Find the minimum sum which is obtained from summing each Two integers product .

Notes
Array/list will contain positives only .
Array/list will always has even size
Input >> Output Examples
minSum({5,4,2,3}) ==> return (22) 

Explanation:
The minimum sum obtained from summing each two integers product , 5*2 + 3*4 = 22

function minSum(arr) {
  let sort = arr.sort((a,b) => b - a)
  let sum = 0
  
  for(let i=0; i<sort.length/2; i++){
    sum += sort[i] * sort[sort.length - 1 - i]
  }
  
  return sum
  }


Better solution 

function minSum(arr) {
  return arr.sort( (a,b) => a-b )
            .slice(0, arr.length/2)
            .reduce( (acc,curr,index) => acc += curr * arr[ arr.length - index - 1 ], 0 )
}
