Maximum Gap (Array Series #4)


Introduction and Warm-up (Highly recommended)
Playing With Lists/Arrays Series

Task
Given an array/list [] of integers , Find The maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Notes
Array/list size is at least 3 .
Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives and negatives also zeros_
Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.
The Maximum Gap is computed Regardless the sign.

Input >> Output Examples
maxGap ({13,10,5,2,9}) ==> return (4)

Explanation:
The Maximum Gap after sorting the array is 4 , The difference between 9 - 5 = 4 .


function maxGap (numbers){
  
  let arr = numbers.sort((a,b) => b - a)
  let newArr = []
  
  for(let i=arr.length - 2; i>=0; i--) {
     newArr.push((arr[i] - arr[i+1] )  ) 
  }
  
  return ( Math.max(...newArr)  ) 
  

}
