Array Leaders (Array Series #3)

Introduction and Warm-up (Highly recommended)
Playing With Lists/Arrays Series

Definition
An element is leader if it is greater than The Sum all the elements to its right side.

Task
Given an array/list [] of integers , Find all the LEADERS in the array.

Notes
Array/list size is at least 3 .
Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives , negatives and zeros
Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.
Returned Array/list should store the leading numbers in the same order in the original array/list .

Input >> Output Examples
arrayLeaders ({1, 2, 3, 4, 0}) ==> return {4}

Explanation:
4 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side
Note : The last element 0 is equal to right sum of its elements (abstract zero).



function arrayLeaders(numbers){
  let lastNum = numbers[numbers.length - 1]
  let newArr = []
  if(lastNum > 0) newArr.push(lastNum)
  
   
  
  for(let i=numbers.length - 2 ; i>=0; i--){
    if(numbers[i] > numbers.slice(i+1).reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0)){
      newArr.push(numbers[i])
    }
  }
  
   return newArr.reverse()
}
