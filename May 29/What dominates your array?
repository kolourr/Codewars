A zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers is given. The dominator of array arr is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of arr.
For example, consider array arr such that arr = [3,4,3,2,3,1,3,3]
The dominator of arr is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of arr and 5 is more than a half of 8.
Write a function dominator(arr) that, given a zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers, returns the dominator of arr. The function should return âˆ’1 if array does not have a dominator. All values in arr will be >=0.

function dominator(arr) {
      const counts = {};
      arr.forEach(function (x) { counts[x] = (counts[x] || 0) + 1; });
      let bigCount = Object.values(counts).sort((a,b) => b - a)[0]
      let dominator = Object.keys(counts).find(key => counts[key] === bigCount)
      
      return bigCount > arr.length/2 ? Number(dominator) : -1 


}
